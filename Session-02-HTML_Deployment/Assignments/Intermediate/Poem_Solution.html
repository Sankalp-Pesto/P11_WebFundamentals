	    <p>I'm Nobody!Who are you?<br>
	       Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
	       Then there's a pair of us!<br>
	       Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>

          <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
             How public - like a Frog -<br>
             To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br>
             To an admiring Bog!</p>
