    <div class="box">
        <h1>Box Model-Border Box Example</h1>
        <p>This is a div with box model properties applied. It has margin, padding, and border, which affect its total
            size and spacing. This is a long text that may overflow, but the word-wrap property prevents it from causing
            horizontal scrollbars.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>Content Box- Since thix excludes border and padding, it increases</h2>
        <p>This is a nested div inside the parent box. It also has box model properties applied, but with different
            values. Note how the content box size is affected by the padding and border, as per the box-sizing
            property. This is another long text that may overflow, but the word-wrap property prevents it from
            causing horizontal scrollbars.</p>
