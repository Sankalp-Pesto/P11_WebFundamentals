    <!-- The "alt" attribute is used to provide alternative text for the image. In this example, the alt text is "An example image". -->
    <p>This is an example of using alt text in an HTML image. Alt text is used to provide a text alternative to images,
        which can be read by screen readers for accessibility purposes. Alt text should be descriptive and convey the
        purpose or content of the image.</p>
    <p>If the image is purely decorative and does not convey any meaningful information, an empty alt attribute can be
        used like this: <code>alt=""</code>. This indicates to screen readers that the image is decorative and should be
        skipped.</p>
